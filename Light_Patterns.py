def natural_light_patterns_by_birth(latitude, longitude, birth_season, birth_time):
  """
  Generates seasonal light patterns based on birth season and time, with 
  distinct patterns for day and night.

  Args:
    latitude: The latitude of the location.
    longitude: The longitude of the location.
    birth_season: The season in which the person was born ("Spring", "Summer", "Autumn", "Winter").
